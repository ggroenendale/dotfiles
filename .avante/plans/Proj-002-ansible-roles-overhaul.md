# Project Plan: Ansible Roles Overhaul and Refactor

> **⚠️ AGENT SAFETY LOCK — READ BEFORE PROCEEDING**
>
> **DO NOT EXECUTE ANY WORK ON THIS PROJECT WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER AUTHORIZATION.**
>
> This project plan is a reference document only. No work may be performed on any phase, step, or deliverable unless the user has given a clear, unambiguous instruction to do so in the current conversation.
>
> **Rules for AI agents:**
>
> 1. **Do not** start, continue, or resume any work on this project autonomously.
> 2. **Do not** create, modify, or delete any files related to this project unless the user explicitly asks you to.
> 3. **Do not** assume that because this file exists, work is authorized — it is not.
> 4. **Do not** offer to begin working on any phase or step. Wait for the user to ask.
> 5. If the user asks a general question about this plan (e.g., "what's in Phase 3?"), answer the question only — do not offer to execute it.
> 6. If the user gives a specific instruction to modify or execute part of this plan, proceed only with that exact instruction.
>
> **Why this exists:** AI agents lose context between sessions. Without this lock, an agent could resume a previous conversation's context and start modifying files or running commands without the user's knowledge or consent. This lock ensures the user remains in control at all times.
>
> **To authorize work:** The user will explicitly say something like "Start Phase 0" or "Work on step 1.1". Until then, do nothing.

## Project Overview

**Project ID:** Proj-002
**Status:** Planning
**Start Date:** 2026-05-06
**Target Completion:** 2026-05-06
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-06

### Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Refactor and rebuild the Ansible roles directory from the ground up, removing legacy code and building clean, modular roles
- **Key Objectives:**
  1. Audit and inventory all existing Ansible roles
  2. Remove or archive legacy OmniProvisioner dead code
  3. Build clean, modular roles with OS detection, idempotency, and proper tagging
  4. Organize roles by function with clear naming conventions
  5. Fix all broken references and empty placeholder files
  6. Create proper playbooks for each machine type (laptop, desktop, server, router, HTPC)

### Success Criteria

- All legacy OmniProvisioner roles removed or archived
- Each role has a clear, single responsibility and is properly tagged
- Playbooks reference only roles that exist and are functional
- No empty placeholder files remain
- All broken sub-role references are fixed
- Machine-type playbooks (laptop, desktop, server, router, HTPC) are complete and functional

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Complete inventory of all existing Ansible roles and sub-roles
- Refactoring of legacy OmniProvisioner references
- Restructuring of role directory hierarchy
- Fixing all broken sub-role references
- Implementing or removing all empty placeholder files
- Creating complete playbooks for each machine type
- Adding proper OS detection and idempotency to all roles
- Adding proper tagging to all roles

### Out of Scope

- Rewriting the bootstrap playbook (already functional)
- Migrating roles to Ansible Galaxy or collections format
- Adding new functionality beyond what currently exists
- Creating CI/CD pipelines for Ansible testing
- Containerizing the Ansible control node

### Key Issues Summary

1. **Broken sub-role references:**
   - `desktop/tasks/main.yaml` references `_wayland/` which does not exist
   - `dev/tasks/main.yaml` references `_version_control/gitea/` which does not exist

2. **30+ empty `main.yaml` files** — many sub-roles have empty main.yaml with actual content in separate files (e.g., `fuzzel.yaml`, `wallpaper.yaml`, `clipboard.yaml`)

3. **Legacy references:**
   - `arch_desktop.yaml` references `~/OmniProvisioner/roles/arch_desktop` (external repo)

4. **Inconsistent structure:**
   - Most sub-roles use `_` prefix (e.g., `_base_packages`, `_hyprland`)
   - Some don't (e.g., `bluez`, `fonts`, `networking`)
   - `_version_control/git` uses nested sub-role structure

5. **No clear machine-type categorization** — roles are flat, playbooks should compose them but many are empty

6. **`debian_server.yaml` is misconfigured** — targets `debian_router` host group and includes desktop/graphics roles

7. **5 of 11 playbooks are empty or stubs** — need implementation

8. **Copy-paste errors** — `storage/_lvm/tasks/main.yaml` has both volumes referencing the same device path

### Design Principles

1. **OS detection at the role level** — Each role handles its own OS detection internally, not via external orchestrators.
2. **Idempotent by design** — Every task should be safe to run multiple times.
3. **Tagged for selective execution** — Each role has meaningful tags for running subsets of the playbook.

## Work Breakdown

### Phase 0 — Inventory & Audit

#### Phase 0 Status

| Item                     | Status                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Phase Complete**       | ❌ No                          |
| **Completed By**         | -                              |
| **Completion Date**      | -                              |
| **Deliverable Location** | -                              |
| **Next Phase**           | [Phase 1 - Structure Design]() |

**Goal:** Create a complete inventory of all roles, playbooks, tasks, handlers, and configurations in the repository, documenting their purpose, dependencies, and stow package location.

> **Note:** The files from `.config/` and `.local/` have already been moved into `stow/` subdirectories. The inventory should be created by analyzing the current `stow/` directory structure rather than the original locations — the stow packages are the authoritative source.

#### Phase 0 Deliverables

| #   | Deliverable            | Description | Location                                                                     |
| --- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Complete Inventory** |             | `.avante/context/project_deliverables/proj-002/Deliverable 1 - Inventory.md` |

#### 0.1 — Inventory all top-level roles

- Create a list of current roles within ansible/roles/
- For each role note any handlers and additional files
- Don't record any file content just note the names and paths
- Some top level roles contain sub roles, these are covered in step 0.2. Leave a section for sub roles to be filled

#### 0.2 — Inventory all sub-roles

- Some roles contain sub roles, add these into the top level roles
- Note additional files and handlers within sub roles
- If a top level does not contain sub roles, fill out that top levels sub role section as "No Sub Roles to Note."

#### 0.3 — Inventory all playbooks

- Record all available playbooks and what roles they run.
- Note blank playbooks.
- The test.yaml playbook is a special playbook used to validate install scripts and using correct file paths.
- The bootstrap.yaml playbook is used by every install script to make sure the base requirements are always covered.

#### 0.4 — Document broken references

- Find missing references in playbooks and note them

#### 0.5 — Document empty files

- Document all empty files within role directories

#### 0.6 — Document legeacy references

- Note references to OmniProvisioner which was the legacy project
- Anything that references OmniProvisioner needs to be refactored into this project

#### 0.7 — Inventory all role README.md files

- Inventory all available README.md files
- Note any role that does not have a README.md file
- Note any README.md file that is empty

### Phase 1 — Structure Design (Todo)

#### Phase 1 Status

| Item                     | Status                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Phase Complete**       | ❌ No                        |
| **Completed By**         | -                            |
| **Completion Date**      | -                            |
| **Deliverable Location** | -                            |
| **Next Phase**           | [Phase 2 - Legacy Cleanup]() |

**Goal:** Design the new role directory hierarchy and create empty scaffolding for all roles. Define naming conventions, tagging conventions, and update configuration files to support the new structure.

#### Phase 1 Deliverables

| #   | Deliverable          | Description                                      | Location |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| 1   | **Structure Design** | Design new role hierarchy and naming conventions | —        |

#### 1.1 — Create new role directory hierarchy

- Create the new directory structure under `ansible/roles/` with categories: `core/`, `hardware/`, `system/`, `desktop/`, `dev/`, `server/`, `archive/`
- Each category directory should contain subdirectories for each role as defined in the [Proposed Role Hierarchy](#proposed-role-hierarchy)
- Do not copy any role content yet — this phase is about creating the empty directory structure only

#### 1.2 — Create empty role scaffolding

- For each new role, create the standard Ansible role scaffolding:
  - `tasks/main.yaml` — empty entry point (will be populated in later phases)
  - `handlers/main.yaml` — empty handlers file
  - `vars/` directory — for OS-specific variable files
  - `templates/` directory — for Jinja2 templates
  - `files/` directory — for static files
- This ensures all roles have a consistent starting structure

#### 1.3 — Define tagging convention for all roles

- Define a consistent tagging scheme for all roles
- Tags should allow selective execution of role subsets (e.g., `--tags desktop`, `--tags networking`)
- Document the convention in this plan for reference during implementation phases

#### 1.4 — Update ansible.cfg roles_path if needed

- Check if `ansible.cfg` has a `roles_path` setting that needs updating
- If the new directory structure requires a path change, update it now
- Verify the configuration is valid with `ansible-playbook --syntax-check`

### Phase 2 — Legacy Cleanup (Todo)

#### Phase 2 Status

| Item                     | Status                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Phase Complete**       | ❌ No                    |
| **Completed By**         | -                        |
| **Completion Date**      | -                        |
| **Deliverable Location** | -                        |
| **Next Phase**           | [Phase 3 - Core Roles]() |

**Goal:** Remove all broken references, legacy OmniProvisioner references, and empty placeholder files from the existing role structure. Archive deprecated roles that are no longer needed.

#### Phase 2 Deliverables

| #   | Deliverable        | Description                                          | Location |
| --- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | **Legacy Cleanup** | Remove OmniProvisioner references, archive dead code | —        |

#### 2.1 — Remove `_wayland` reference from `desktop/tasks/main.yaml`

- The `desktop/tasks/main.yaml` file references a `_wayland` sub-role that does not exist
- Remove the include statement for `_wayland` from the file
- If Wayland infrastructure is needed, it will be handled by the `desktop/hyprland/` role in the new structure

#### 2.2 — Remove `_version_control/gitea` reference from `dev/tasks/main.yaml`

- The `dev/tasks/main.yaml` file references a `_version_control/gitea` sub-role that does not exist
- Remove the include statement for `gitea` from the file
- Gitea can be added as a future enhancement if needed

#### 2.3 — Remove OmniProvisioner reference from `arch_desktop.yaml`

- The `arch_desktop.yaml` playbook references `~/OmniProvisioner/roles/arch_desktop` — an external repository that no longer exists
- Remove this role reference from the playbook
- All functionality from the old OmniProvisioner project has been migrated into this repository

#### 2.4 — Move `_refined/` to `archive/` directory

- The `bootloader/_refined/` sub-role contains only a README with no actual tasks
- Move this directory to `ansible/roles/archive/_refined/` to keep it available for reference but out of the active role path
- Update any references to the old location

#### 2.5 — Remove empty placeholder files (30+ empty main.yaml files)

- Many sub-roles have empty `main.yaml` files with actual content in separate files (e.g., `fuzzel.yaml`, `wallpaper.yaml`, `clipboard.yaml`)
- Remove the empty `main.yaml` files where they serve no purpose
- For roles that have no content at all (e.g., `ai/` sub-roles), either implement or remove them
- Document which files were removed for reference

### Phase 3 — Core Roles (core/)

#### Phase 3 Status

| Item                     | Status         |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Phase Complete**       | ❌ No          |
| **Completed By**         | -              |
| **Completion Date**      | -              |
| **Deliverable Location** | -              |
| **Next Phase**           | [Phase 4 - ]() |

**Goal:**

#### Phase 3 Deliverables

| #   | Deliverable    | Description                                            | Location |
| --- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| 1   | **Core Roles** | Rebuild base, users, security, systemd, dotfiles roles | —        |
